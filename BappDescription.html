<p>This BurpSuite extension allows you, in a quick and simple way, to improve
the active and passive BurpSuite scanner by means of personalized rules
through a very intuitive graphical interface. Through an advanced search of
patterns and an improvement of the payload to send, we can create our own
issue profiles both in the active scanner and in the passive.</p>

<p>For usage manual please consult <a href="https://github.com/wagiro/BurpBounty/wiki/usage">the wiki</a>.</p>

<p>You can download profile examples from <a href="https://github.com/wagiro/BurpBounty/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>For further information, consult the documentation in the source code repository.</p>
