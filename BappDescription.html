<p>This extension allows you, in a quick and simple way, to improve the active and passive burpsuite scanner by means of personalized rules through a very intuitive graphical interface.
    Through an advanced search of patterns and an improvement of the payload to send, we can create our own issue profiles both in the active scanner and in the passive.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Configure a profile directory.</li>
    <li>Define one or more profiles, which can include:
        <ul>
            <li>Payloads</li>
            <li>Payload encoders</li>
            <li>Grep match expressions</li>
            <li>Detection options</li>
            <li>Issue description</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The checks are automatically invoked when a Burp active or passive scan is run.</li>
</ol>

<p>For further information, consult the documentation in the source code repository.</p>
